# github-demo
In this repo, I am just learning how to use Github &amp; how this version control basically functions. Good luck to me!
Commit: here shows, how many times you've made changes in the repo. The moment you make one repo, count initalizes to 1. I did some grammatical error so I corrected that twice which leads to 3, and now when i am writting this it would be 4.
