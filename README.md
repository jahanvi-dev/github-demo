# github-demo
In this repo, I am just learning how to use Github &amp; how this version control basically functions. Good luck to me!
Commit here shows, how many times you've made changes. The moment you make one counts as 1, I did some grammatical error so i corrected that counts goes up 2, and now when i am writting this it would be 3.
