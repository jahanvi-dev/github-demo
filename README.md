# github-demo
In this repo, I am just learning how to use Github &amp; how this version control basically functions. Good luck to me!
Commit: here shows, how many times you've made changes in the repo. The moment you make one repo, count initalizes to 1. I did some grammatical error so I corrected that twice which leads to 3, and now when i am writting this it would be 4.


# üëâ Now,
The changes from here are all committed from the VS Editor using Git.


# ‚û°Ô∏è Let's talk about some basic Git Commands :
1) For cloning a repository from Github use command - git clone <link of the website>

2) To go inside the folder you're working on use command - cd <folder name>

3) To see files inside the folder use command - ls

4) To clean the terminal use command - clear

5) To check the status of the file use command - git status

# (There are 4 stages of files in git let's dicuss them) :
a) Untracked -  files which are not tracked by the git, git dosen't have a clue about the modification or deletion in it.
b) Unmodified - files which are tracked by the git, for the changes taking place in the file. Mid level stage between untracked and modified
c) Modified -   changes which are now staged to git, but haven't been pushed yet to the root app(Github in this case).
d) Staged -     changes which are saved, and pushed to the root app via git command.


6) To save the changes made in the file we use command - git add <file name>

7) To commit those changes, meaning to put them on stage we use command - git commit -m"some meaningful message here"

8) To see all these changes on the remote app use command - git push origin main
